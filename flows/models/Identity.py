    An Identity neural network module implemented using Flax. 
    
    This module performs the identity function, $f(x) = x$, for any input $x$. 
    It is useful as a placeholder, a bypass, or as the initial or final layer 
    in complex architectures like Normalizing Flows or multi-step models where 
    the transformation should sometimes be null.
    
    This module contains no parameters or internal state.

        Applies the identity function.

        The `mode` argument is accepted for API consistency with other flow layers 
        (e.g., in `CompositeModel`), but it has no effect on the output.

        Args:
            x (jnp.ndarray): The input data.
            mode (evaluationMode, optional): The evaluation mode. Ignored. 
                                            Defaults to 'direct'.
