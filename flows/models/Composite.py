class CompositeModel(nn.Module):
    """
    A Flax module that chains together a list of other Flax modules, 
    allowing for sequential composition in a 'direct' mode and 
    reverse composition in an 'inverse' mode. 
    
    This is commonly used in constructing deep architectures like 
    Normalizing Flows, where the forward pass is a sequence of transformations
    and the inverse pass is the reverse sequence of inverse transformations.

    Attributes:
        models (List[nn.Module]): A list of Flax modules to be applied sequentially.
